Change in the useful lives of our server and network equipment (unaudited)
In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of
certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective
beginning in fiscal year 2021 and the effect was a reduction in depreciation expense of $721 million and
$1.6 billion and an increase in net income of $561 million and $1.2 billion, or $0.84 and $1.81 per basic and $0.83
and $1.78 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively.
Stock Repurchase
As we previously announced in April 2021, the Alphabet board authorized the company to repurchase up to an
additional $50 billion of its Class C capital stock under our stock repurchase program. On July 22, 2021, the board
approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program permitting us to repurchase both Class A and Class C
shares, in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the
economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A
and Class C shares.
