Additional Information Relating to Fiscal Year 2023 (unaudited)
Recent Announcements
In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to incur
employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the
first quarter of 2023.
In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs relating
to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in
the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.
Change in Useful lives of our server and network equipment
In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a
change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result
in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of
December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and research and development (R&D) expenses.
Segment Reporting Changes
As Al is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in
January 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet's Al activities. DeepMind, previously
reported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration
with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Prior periods will be recast to conform to the revised
presentation.
