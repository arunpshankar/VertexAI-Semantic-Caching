Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q4 2022, the net effect of the loss on equity
securities of $1.5 billion and the $193 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments
decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $272 million, $1.0 billion, and $0.08, respectively.
Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly
contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
