"The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges," said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO.
"With AWS growing 34% annually over the last two years, and 37% year-over-year in the first quarter, AWS has been integral
in helping companies weather the pandemic and move more of their workloads into the cloud. Our Consumer business has
grown 23% annually over the past two years, with extraordinary growth in 2020 of 39% year-over-year that necessitated
doubling the size of our fulfillment network that we'd built over Amazon's first 25 years—and doing so in just 24 months.
Today, as we're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and
cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some
time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a
number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we're now approaching levels not seen
since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020."
