these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency
with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are
used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial
measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in
accordance with GAAP.
For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation from
net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" and "Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP
constant currency revenues" included at the end of this release.
