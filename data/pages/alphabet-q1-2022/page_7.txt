Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions; unaudited):
We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including
investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues (in millions, except
percentages; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues and the non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency
revenues because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of
foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are not indicative of our core operating results.
