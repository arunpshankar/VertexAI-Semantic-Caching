Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments. For Q1 2022, the net effect of the loss on
equity securities of $1,070 million and the $233 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain
investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $176 million, $661 million, and $0.99,
respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could
significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
