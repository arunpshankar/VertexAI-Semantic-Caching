Change in the useful lives of our server and network equipment (unaudited)
In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of
certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective
beginning in fiscal year 2021, and the effect for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021,
respectively, was a reduction in depreciation expense of $446 million and $2.6 billion and an increase in net income
of $347 million and $2.0 billion, or $0.52 and $3.02 per basic share and $0.52 and $2.98 per diluted share.
Stock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend ("Stock Split")
Alphabet today announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one stock split (the
"Stock Split") in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company's Class A, Class B,

and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class B, and
Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split.
If approval is obtained, each of the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the
"Record Date"), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the
same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.
