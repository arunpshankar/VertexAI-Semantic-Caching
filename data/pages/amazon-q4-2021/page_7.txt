The Amazon Housing Equity Fund, the company's $2 billion commitment to creating and preserving affordable
homes, launched a $21 million pilot program to accelerate opportunities for real estate developers of color. The
program is open to developers focused on affordable housing initiatives in the Puget Sound region of Washington
state; the Arlington, Virginia region; and Nashville, Tennessee. The program includes professional education, training,
mentorship, and grant funding to help cover upfront real estate development costs. Separately, the Amazon Housing
Equity Fund also committed $160 million in low-rate loans to help preserve more than 1,300 affordable homes for 99
years in Arlington.
To further underscore Amazon's ongoing commitment to gender equity, Amazon signed the United Nation's Women's
Empowerment Principles (WEPs). The WEPs, established by the United Nations Global Compact and UN Women,
help businesses collectively promote gender equity and empower women in the workplace and global community.
Amazon announced a $1 million contribution to the Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains. Founded in
2020, the fund aims to tackle systemic challenges underlying the profound and pressing needs of women during the

shelter equipment, and water, to support communities affected by tornadoes in the Midwest and Southern U.S.;
wildfires in Colorado; and flooding in Chennai and Uttarakhand, India, and in British Columbia, Canada.
Amazon announced it has now delivered more than 20 million meals to vulnerable families disproportionately
impacted by COVID-19 in more than 25 U.S. cities and communities in Australia, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and the
UK. Since March 2020, Amazon has volunteered its delivery network to support food banks and community
