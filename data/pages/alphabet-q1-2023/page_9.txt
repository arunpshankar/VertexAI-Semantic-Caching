Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q1 2023, the net effect of the gain on equity
securities of $377 million and the $118 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain
investments increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $104 million, $391 million, and $0.03,
respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could
significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions; unaudited):
We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including
investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.
