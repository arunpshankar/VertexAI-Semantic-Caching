As of March 31, 2023, the number of employees includes almost all of the employees affected by the reduction of our
workforce. We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter
of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.
Segment Operating Results
Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in
the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead of within
Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation
methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have
been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below.
As announced on April 20, 2023, we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind
to significantly accelerate our progress in Al. This change does not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called
Google DeepMind, will be reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of
2023.
