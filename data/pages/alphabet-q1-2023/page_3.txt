Additional information relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (unaudited)
Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space
In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we
recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs
associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we
recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur
additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.
These severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):

Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment
In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain
network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal
year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a reduction in depreciation expense of
$988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share.
Timing of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants
Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to
March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full
fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining
quarters of the year.
Stock Repurchases
On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional
$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its
stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading
prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to
time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.
