in certain employee-related expenses and business taxes. General and administrative included an
unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.
OTHER INCOME, NET
Other income, net was $310 million driven by interest and dividends income and net gains on
investments, offset in part by interest expense.
INCOME TAXES
The current quarter effective tax rate was 15% compared to 17% in the prior year. The decrease in our
effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from an agreement between the U.S. and China related
to transfer pricing and tax benefits from the conclusion of a foreign tax audit.
REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts
that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $146 billion as of June 30, 2021, of
which $141 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize
approximately 50% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
