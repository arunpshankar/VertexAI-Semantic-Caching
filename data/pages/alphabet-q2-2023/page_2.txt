The substantial majority of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce are no longer included in
our headcount as of June 30, 2023. We expect most of the remaining employees affected will no longer be
reflected in our headcount by the end of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.
Segment Operating Results
As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to
significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported
within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the
Brain team was included within Google Services.
