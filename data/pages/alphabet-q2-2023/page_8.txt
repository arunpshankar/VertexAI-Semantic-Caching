Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,
Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales
of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as
YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.
Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for
enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform
services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues
from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.
Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs
primarily include Al-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities;
corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and
settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are
not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our
segments.
