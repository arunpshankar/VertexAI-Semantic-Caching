OPERATING EXPENSES
Research and development expenses decreased $110 million or 2% driven by a decline in Devices,
offset in part by investments in LinkedIn.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $100 million or 2% primarily driven by declines in
Windows, LinkedIn, and Devices advertising.
General and administrative expenses increased $448 million or 26% driven by a charge related to
the IDPC matter.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other income (expense), net was $473 million driven by interest and dividends income, offset in part by
interest expense.
INCOME TAXES
The current quarter effective tax rate was 19% compared to 18% in the prior year. The increase in our
effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.
REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts
that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $229 billion as of June 30, 2023, of
which $224 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize
approximately 45% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
