Non-GAAP constant currency revenues and percentage change: We define non-GAAP constant currency revenues as total
revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and we use it to determine the
constant currency revenue percentage change on year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. Non-GAAP constant currency
revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging
effect recognized in the current quarter. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase
in current quarter non-GAAP constant currency revenues over prior period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in
the prior period.
