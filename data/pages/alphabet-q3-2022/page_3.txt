About non-GAAP financial measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,
we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage
change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be
indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign
exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from
referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and
analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to
our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe
these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency
with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are
used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial
measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in
accordance with GAAP.
For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliation from
net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" and "Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP
constant currency revenues" included at the end of this release.
