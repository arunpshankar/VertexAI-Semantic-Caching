Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments that we hold. For Q1 2021, the net effect of
the gain on equity securities of $4,837 million and the performance fees of $665 million increased the provision for income
tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $876 million, $3,296 million, and $4.83, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our
investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors, such as operating and financial performance of the
companies we invest in, and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
