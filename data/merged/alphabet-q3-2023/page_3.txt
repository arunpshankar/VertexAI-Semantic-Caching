Additional Information Relating to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited)
Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space
In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and
related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million and $649 million, respectively. In
addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million
in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further
evaluate our real estate needs.
For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in
our segment results.
Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment
In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain
network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal
year 2023, and the effect was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase
in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
