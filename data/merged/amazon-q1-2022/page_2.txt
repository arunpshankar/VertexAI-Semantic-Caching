This
year, Prime Day will take place in July in more than 20 countries. During Amazon's annual shopping event,
Prime members will be able to save on products from national brands and small businesses across every category.
Amazon continued to invent and expand ways for customers to discover fashion products. For example, View in 3D
enables customers in the U.S. and Canada to view a shoe at any angle, and The Drop provides customers worldwide
with access to limited-edition, size-inclusive clothing collections by fashion influencers globally. Amazon also
launched Style Feed, a shoppable stream of influencer-curated content on the Amazon shopping app for customers in
the U.S. and India to explore fashion, home décor, and beauty items.
Amazon launched Amazon Aware, a new brand of consciously created everyday products that span apparel, home, and
beauty, and that are made from materials such as recycled polyester, organic cotton, and bio-based ingredients. All
Amazon Aware products are certified as carbon neutral and feature certifications that are part of Amazon's Climate
Pledge Friendly program.
Amazon opened eight new Amazon Fresh grocery stores and now has 46 Amazon Fresh grocery stores around the
world. The newest Amazon Fresh store in Seattle is the world's first grocery store seeking Zero Carbon certification
from the International Future Living Institute and features more than a dozen store design upgrades expected to save
nearly 185 tons of carbon emissions each year when compared to an industry-standard grocery store.
Amazon opened a new, larger Amazon Go store format for customers in suburban areas in the U.S., with the first
location in Mill Creek, Washington. The new format features Amazon's Just Walk Out technology for a checkout-free
shopping experience, an expanded selection of grab-and-go food and beverage items, and a Made-to-Order kitchen
with freshly prepared, customizable breakfast and lunch items. Amazon has plans to expand this format to the Los
Angeles area in the coming months.
For the first time, Amazon introduced Just Walk Out technology at two Whole Foods Market stores in Washington,
D.C., and Sherman Oaks, California. Just Walk Out technology also rolled out at new third-party locations, including
travel retailer WHSmith in LaGuardia Airport in New York City; UBS Arena in New York; and Minute Maid Park in
Houston, Texas. In addition, a food and beverage store equipped with Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One will
be opening soon at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. The combination of technologies will give fans the option to enter the
store with their palm or credit card, take what they want, and leave without stopping to check out.
Amazon Business launched Punch-in, an industry-first procurement tool that simplifies the buying experience for
businesses. With Punch-in, businesses can start their purchasing directly on Amazon Business and submit their cart to
their e-Procurement system for purchase order creation and reconciliation.
