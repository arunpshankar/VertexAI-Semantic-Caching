Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions; unaudited):
We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including
investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.
