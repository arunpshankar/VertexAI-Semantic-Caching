Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn't know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:
•
•
•
Launched product review highlights, a new generative AI-powered feature that lets shoppers in Amazon's U.S. store
quickly determine what other customers are saying about a product before reading through reviews. Review highlights
provide a short paragraph on the product detail page with features and customer sentiment frequently mentioned across
reviews.
Introduced generative AI capabilities to help sellers create product listings as part of numerous innovations at
Accelerate 2023, Amazon's annual seller conference. Other announcements included an end-to-end, fully automated
set of supply chain services called Supply Chain by Amazon that allows sellers to quickly and reliably move products
directly from their manufacturers to customers. In India, Amazon also announced a generative AI-based digital
assistant to help small businesses establish an ecommerce presence. The tool will help sellers with registration, listing,
and advertising.
Previewed a smarter and more conversational Alexa, powered by generative AI and an LLM custom-built for voice
interactions. New conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once, make more
ambiguous smart home requests, set up an Alexa Routine entirely by voice instead of the app, and make more natural
and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases or device names.
Announced new LLM tools that will make it easier for developers to create more conversational and intuitive Alexa
experiences for their customers. Brands using these new tools include BMW, Character. AI, iRobot, Philips Hue,
Splash, and Volley.
Introduced the next-generation Echo Show 8 built-in smart home hub that can process common smart home requests
40% faster than previous generations, Echo Hub smart home control panel to manage smart home devices, and next-
generation Echo Frames smart audio glasses with hands-free access to Alexa, extended battery life, and improved
audio.
Announced updates to the Fire TV experience, including an enhanced AI-powered Fire TV voice search, so customers
can ask Alexa open-ended questions about TV shows and movies using conversational language; a “Continue
Watching" row that aggregates content from streaming entertainment providers, including Amazon Freevee, Disney+,
Hulu, MGM+, Peacock, and STARZ; and an AI Art feature, so customers can create artwork on their Fire TV devices
using their voice.
Unveiled the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which comes with the Fire TV Ambient Experience that turns the TV into an
always-smart display so customers can see Calendars and Reminders, control smart devices, or play audio. Amazon
also introduced the Fire TV Stick 4K with support for Wi-Fi 6, and the Fire TV Soundbar that provides room-filling
sound with support for DTS Virtual:X and Dolby Audio.
Expanded home security offerings with the Ring Stick Up Cam Pro, giving customers an aerial perspective to pinpoint
and send more accurate alerts; Blink Outdoor 4, with improved image quality for person detection; and Blink Sync
Module Pro with extended range, giving customers options in where they install their cameras.
Introduced eero Max 7, which combines patented TrueMesh networking technology with the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard to
dramatically increase speeds, avoid interference, and improve latency.
Kicked off Project Kuiper's Protoflight mission with the launch of two prototype satellites aboard an Atlas V rocket
from United Launch Alliance. Project Kuiper, Amazon's low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative, will use this
multimonth mission to test its satellites and network from space, and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite
production later this year. Project Kuiper also announced a partnership with Vodafone and Vodacom to extend the
reach of their 4G/5G networks in Africa and Europe, provide backup to businesses, scale for major events, and quickly
recover after disasters.
Enhanced the viewing experience for Thursday Night Football with AI-driven features powered by AWS, such as
Prime Targets and Defensive Alerts. Prime Targets uses ML to highlight which receivers are in position to convert a
first down. Defensive Alerts uses a generative AI model that grows more accurate over time to identify players that are
likely to rush the quarterback.
Announced new AWS technologies and capabilities that help customers of all sizes take advantage of generative AI,
improve productivity, and enhance their security posture. Customers are using Amazon Bedrock to bring generative AI
to their businesses, including adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater Associates, Clariant, Coda, GoDaddy, LexisNexis
