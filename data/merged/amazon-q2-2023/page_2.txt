"It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon," said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. "We continued lowering our cost to
serve in our fulfillment network, while also providing Prime customers with the fastest delivery speeds we've ever recorded.
Our AWS growth stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment, and AWS has
continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases that make it much
easier and more cost-effective for companies to train and run models (Trainium and Inferentia chips), customize Large
Language Models to build generative AI applications and agents (Bedrock), and write code much more efficiently with
Code Whisperer. We're also continuing to see strong demand for our advertising services as the team keeps innovating for
brands, including the ramp up for Thursday Night Football with the ability for advertisers to tailor their spots by audience and
create interactive experiences for consumers. We remain excited about what lies ahead for customers and the company."
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers' lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,
developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:
•
•
•
•
Delivered its largest selection of products to U.S. Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in the quarter. The
company now offers U.S. Prime members free Same-Day or One-Day Delivery on tens of millions of the most popular
items. Across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day
in the quarter. So far this year, Amazon has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or
next day-nearly four times the number of units delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019.
Held the biggest Prime Day event ever on July 11-12, in the third quarter, as Prime members worldwide purchased
more than 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion. This year, Amazon offered more deals than any past
Prime Day, with Home, Fashion, and Beauty among the top-selling deal categories. This was the largest Prime Day
ever for Amazon's independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, and the first where
U.S.-based Prime members could shop deals directly from merchant sites using Buy with Prime.
Increased selection in the U.S. Amazon store. Amazon added new beauty and fashion brands, including D'Amelio
Footwear, Dyson hair care, IT Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren Fragrances, and Urban Decay, and extended its collaboration
with Victoria's Secret. This marks the first time Victoria's Secret lingerie and apparel are available through a retail
partner in North America. Amazon also expanded its selection of grocery items from brands such as General Mills and
Coca-Cola.
Announced Amazon Business is one of our fastest growing offerings, with a $35 billion annualized gross sales run rate
and serving more than 6 million customers. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to
procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at discounted prices.
Enabled customers worldwide to save more than $1 billion in the last 12 months through Subscribe & Save, a program
that helps customers save time and money on regularly scheduled deliveries. Customers select their preferred delivery
frequency for eligible products and can cancel or change their subscription at any time. The program has tens of
millions of global subscribers with hundreds of millions of subscriptions.
Announced that Amazon Day deliveries, which give Prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week
that makes sense for them to receive their orders, saved 136 million boxes in 2022. On top of making deliveries work
for customers' personal schedules, this free Prime benefit uses 30% fewer boxes on average.
Released Amazon's annual U.S. Small Business Empowerment Report for 2022, which detailed that more than 60% of
sales in Amazon's store came from independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses. U.S.-
based independent sellers sold more than 4.1 billion products and averaged more than $230,000 in sales. Amazon also
announced a Small Business Search filter, which helps customers easily discover and shop for products from small
businesses and artisans while shopping in Amazon's store.
Marked the 10th anniversary of Amazon.in and announced that Amazon India has enabled cumulative ecommerce
exports of over $7 billion. By 2025, Amazon India has a goal to enable cumulative ecommerce exports of $20 billion,
digitize 10 million small businesses, and create 2 million jobs in India.
Premiered AIR, which launched in more theaters worldwide than any previous Amazon Original film. The film
subsequently debuted on Prime Video and ranked No. 3 on Nielsen's Streaming Top 10 list during the first three days
of its release. The company also premiered additional Amazon Original films and series including the final seasons of
Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan and Emmy-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel; the global spy thriller Citadel, which was
the No. 1 title on Prime Video in nearly 200 countries and territories during its premiere weekend; and Emmy-
