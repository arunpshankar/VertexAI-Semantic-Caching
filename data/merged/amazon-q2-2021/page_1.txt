Investing in Employee Safety and Providing Good Jobs
Amazon announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with the National Safety Council, a 100-year-old nonprofit that
protects workers on and off the job, to invent new ways of preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), the most
common workplace injury in the U.S. The five-year effort aims to reduce MSDs across a variety of industries by
engaging key stakeholders, conducting new research, inventing technology and processes, and scaling the results.
Amazon is investing over $300 million into safety projects in 2021, including redesigning and retrofitting
workstations, re-engineering cross-dock operations and powered-industrial-truck barriers, and implementing new
safety control systems.
