which can help detect manufacturing and production defects (e.g., cracks, dents, incorrect color, irregular shape, etc.)
in their products and prevent costly errors from progressing down an operational line and reaching customers.
AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Lookout for Metrics, a new fully managed machine learning
service that helps customers monitor the most important metrics for their business (e.g., revenue, web page views,
active users, transaction volume, and mobile app installations) with greater speed and accuracy. The service also
makes it easier to diagnose the root cause of anomalies like unexpected dips in revenue, high rates of abandoned
shopping carts, spikes in payment transaction failures, increases in new user sign-ups, and more.
AWS announced new Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) One Zone storage classes that reduce storage costs by 47%,
compared to existing Amazon EFS storage classes, while delivering the same features and benefits. One Zone storage
classes redundantly store data within a single Availability Zone (AZ). These are ideal for customers who want cost-
optimized file storage for workloads and applications (e.g., content management, developer applications, etc.) that do
not require the level of availability and durability offered by regional Amazon EFS storage classes, which redundantly
store data across multiple geographically separated AZs.
