Continued to expand AWS's infrastructure footprint to support customers, announcing plans to launch the AWS Asia
Pacific (Bangkok) Region in Thailand and opening the second Region in the Middle East, the AWS Middle East
(UAE) Region.
Received CrowdStrike's 2022 Ecosystem Partner of the year award for AWS. Together, CrowdStrike and AWS
delivered end-to-end comprehensive protection that enables AWS customers to build, run, and secure applications with
speed and confidence.
Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn't know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:
•
•
•
•
Introduced a range of new Fire TV devices and entertainment experiences, including the Omni QLED Series smart TV
with hands-free Alexa controls and new ambient features that turn the TV into an always-smart device when not
streaming; and the all-new Fire TV Cube streaming media player with a faster processor for increased app launch
speeds, an industry-first HDMI input port, and Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming.
Introduced the next generation of Echo Dot and Echo Auto, as well as upgrades to Echo Studio. The all-new Echo Dot
and Echo Dot with Clock feature a redesigned audio architecture, and the Echo Dot Kids now comes in Owl and
Dragon designs. The next generation Echo Auto is designed to hear requests over music, the air conditioner, and road
noise, and the new Echo Studio features bass extension and custom-built spatial audio processing technology.
Launched three new Kindle devices: Kindle Scribe, the first Kindle that makes it possible for customers to both read
and write as naturally as they do on paper but with the convenience of Kindle's glare-free Paperwhite display; the
next-generation Kindle, Amazon's lightest and most compact Kindle yet; and the next-generation Kindle Kids.
Expanded the Ring lineup with new security devices and features: Ring Intercom allows customers living in apartment
buildings to use their phone to talk to and buzz in visitors; Spotlight Cam Pro and Spotlight Cam Plus use radar
sensors to detect motion and send more precise alerts; Ring Alarm Panic Button enables customers to get help at the
push of a button in an emergency; and a new integration of Ring Virtual Security Guard and the Amazon Astro robot
for businesses offers expanded security options.
Announced the Blink Wired Floodlight Camera, which features person detection for the first time in a Blink device,
and Blink Mini Pan Tilt accessory, which extends the functionality of the popular Blink Mini with additional
viewpoint capabilities.
Launched a new Alexa feature called Customers ask Alexa that enables brands and selling partners to answer common
customer questions through Alexa and better inform purchase decisions.
Continued to collaborate with leading retailers and stadiums to equip their locations with Just Walk Out technology for
checkout-free shopping and Amazon One for palm recognition and payment. One or both of these technologies are
now available at Texas A&M's Kyle Field, Lumen Field in Seattle, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and a Hudson
Nonstop at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Amazon also continued to roll out Amazon One at Whole Foods
Market stores with the technology now available at over 65 stores in California.
Announced the general availability of new AWS EC2 machine learning training instances (Trn1), which make it
possible to build more accurate machine learning models and reduce training times. AWS-designed Trainium chips are
purpose-built for high-performance machine learning training in the cloud. With Trainium-powered Trn1 instances,
AWS customers can save up to 50% on deep learning training costs over equivalent GPU-based instances.
Announced the general availability of AWS IoT FleetWise, which makes it easier to collect, transform, and transfer
vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors can
use the data to analyze vehicle fleet health and more quickly identify potential recalls or safety issues, make in-vehicle
infotainment systems smarter, and improve advanced technologies like autonomous driving and advanced driver-
assistance systems with analytics and machine learning.
Announced a new alliance and investment with Harvard University to advance fundamental research and innovation in
quantum networking, which will explore applications to combat privacy and security threats. AWS also announced the
AWS Generation Q Fund at the Harvard Quantum Initiative to train the next-generation of quantum scientists and
engineers.
