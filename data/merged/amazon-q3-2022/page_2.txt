“In the past four months, employees across our consumer businesses have worked relentlessly to put together compelling Prime
Member Deal Events with our eighth annual Prime Day and the brand new Prime Early Access Sale in early October. The
customer response to both events was quite positive, and it's clear that particularly during these uncertain economic times,
customers appreciate Amazon's continued focus on value and convenience,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. "We're also
encouraged by the steady progress we're making on lowering costs in our stores fulfillment network, and have a set of
initiatives that we're methodically working through that we believe will yield a stronger cost structure for the business moving
forward. There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we'll balance our investments to be more
streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets. What won't change is our maniacal focus on the customer
experience, and we feel confident that we're ready to deliver a great experience for customers this holiday shopping season."
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers' lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,
developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Premiered several new entertainment series, including The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which attracted
more than 25 million global viewers on its first day, the biggest debut in Prime Video history, and closing in on 100
million viewers to date. The company also premiered three new Original and three returning series, including Heidi
Klum and Tim Gunn's Making the Cut, The Outlaws, starring Christopher Walken and Stephen Merchant; and thriller
The Peripheral, starring Chloë Grace Moretz.
Kicked off the inaugural season of Prime Video as the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football with more
than 15 million viewers for its first game. Live sports also returned to Prime Video across Europe with new seasons of
UEFA Champions League soccer in Germany and Italy, Ligue 1 soccer in France, and exclusive coverage of US Open
tennis in the UK.
Introduced the first-ever Prime Early Access Sale, a two-day shopping event on October 11-12 exclusively for Prime
members in 15 countries. Customers could choose from hundreds of thousands of deals across all best-selling
categories, such as apparel, home, toys and Amazon devices. Amazon's selling partners, most of which are small and
medium-sized businesses, also took part in the event, and customers responded by ordering more than 100 million
items from these businesses.
Opened a dozen new fulfillment centers globally in order to serve more customers even more quickly. New sites were
opened in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and Turkey.
Expanded to Belgium with the launch of Amazon.com.be and a Prime program for local customers, providing faster
access to more than 180 million products across more than 30 product categories. As part of the launch, Amazon
introduced the "Brands of Belgium" storefront to showcase products from Belgian entrepreneurs.
Partnered with new brands and retailers to make their products available on Amazon with same-day delivery for Prime
members in select ZIP codes across over 10 U.S. cities. Examples of these partners include GNC, PacSun, SuperDry,
Sur La Table, and 100% Pure.
Continued working to protect customers from fake reviews through legal action against fake review brokers, filing its
first criminal complaint in Italy and its first lawsuit in Spain. These two legal proceedings, plus 10 other new lawsuits
recently launched in the U.S., target bad actors that operate more than 11,000 websites and social media groups that
attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon and other stores. Amazon stops millions of suspicious reviews before
customers ever see them, and these legal actions help uncover perpetrators and stop the abuse where it starts.
Rolled out Venmo as a new payment option in the U.S., giving customers more choice during the checkout experience.
Hosted Amazon Accelerate, an annual conference dedicated to seller success where numerous new tools were
introduced, including new email marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping
rates, and new features and analytics on conversion-driving content.
Announced new commitments and migrations from AWS customers across many industries and geographies, such as
BMW Group, which extended its work to help BMW's developers derive insights from the data their vehicles produce;
grocery delivery service Schwan's Home Delivery, which is optimizing delivery times across its routes, building and
scaling its technology infrastructure to support evolving consumer preferences, and personalizing product
recommendations; online grocery platform Pick n Pay, which migrated its entire on-premises SAP environment to
AWS to automate operations and deliver real-time insights; German national football league Bundesliga, which
debuted two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to help fans better understand team performance and
