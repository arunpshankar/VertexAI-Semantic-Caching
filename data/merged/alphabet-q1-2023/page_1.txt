Alphabet Announces First Quarter 2023 Results
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - April 25, 2023 - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial
results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: "We are pleased with our business performance in the first
quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored
in deep computer science and Al. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see
huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation."
Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: "Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1
consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed
to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering
our cost base."
Q1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited)
Our first quarter 2023 results reflect:
i.
$2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space;
ii.
a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and
certain network equipment; and
iii. a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of
the year. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the
full fiscal year 2023.
For further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.
