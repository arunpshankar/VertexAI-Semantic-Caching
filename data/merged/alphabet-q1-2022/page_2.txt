Stock Repurchase
On April 20, 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional

stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading
prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to

About non-GAAP financial measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,
we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage
change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be
indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign
exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from
referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and
analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to
our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe
