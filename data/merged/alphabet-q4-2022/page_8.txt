Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions; unaudited):
We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including
investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change
in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (in millions, except percentages;
unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP percentage change
in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues"), because they facilitate the
comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ("FX
Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our
core operating results.
Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate
movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange
rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in
constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues,
excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
