In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Microsoft transferred certain\nintangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the United States. The transfer of intangible\nproperties resulted in a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as the value of\nfuture United States tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the United States Global\nIntangible Low-Taxed Income tax.\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties to\naid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these non-GAAP measures\nassist investors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends\naffecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in\nconjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the\nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this\ninformation, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than\nUnited States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the\ncomparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All\ngrowth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this\nnon-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to,\nthe measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures\nalso facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons\nto our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP\nconstant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in\nconstant currency revenues\" included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\n4\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n=== TABLE START ===\n|    | ('This press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 25, 2023. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law. About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues\" included at the end of this release.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of\ngrowth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our\nestimates as of April 29, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed\nabove, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and\nscope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the\npandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and\nproductivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in\naffected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party\nsellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns,\nincluding impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the second\nquarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate\nimpact on our operations for the second quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect\nconsequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations.\nSecond Quarter 2021 Guidance\n•\n•\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion, or to grow between 24% and 30% compared\nwith second quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $4.5 billion and $8.0 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in second quarter\n2020. This guidance assumes approximately $1.5 billion of costs related to COVID-19.\nThis guidance assumes that Prime Day occurs in second quarter 2021.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or\nlegal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of\nreasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or\nunforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these\nrisks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and\nsubsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information\nabout us.

This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic\nand geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify\nmany of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in\nAmazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information\nabout us.

Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition,\nglobal economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give\nrise to or amplify many of these risks.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Microsoft transferred certain\nintangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the United States. The transfer of intangible\nproperties resulted in a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as the value of\nfuture United States tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the United States Global\nIntangible Low-Taxed Income tax.\nThe India Supreme Court Decision Impact. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court issued a decision on\nwithholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The\nCommissioner of Income Tax. Microsoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales\nthrough distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India Supreme Court ruled\nfavorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are\nnot subject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft's\nsoftware sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft\nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the\nresults of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties and\nthe India Supreme Court decision to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft\nbelieves these non-GAAP measures assist investors by providing additional insight into its operational\nperformance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management\nconsiders non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business\nperformance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this\ninformation, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than\nUnited States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the\ncomparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All\ngrowth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this\nnon-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance.

Actual results may\ndiffer materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future\nperformance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted\ninclude, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\n30, 2022, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor\nand on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2022. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of\nFebruary 2, 2023. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which\nare based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless\nrequired by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we\nuse the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change\nin constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with\nGAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate\nperiod-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our\nrecurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate\nmovements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management\nand investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's\ninternal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating\nresults. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2)\nthey are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from net\ncash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP\nconstant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues\" included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\n3\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court issued a decision on\nwithholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The\nCommissioner of Income Tax. The decision involves appeals filed by 86 individual companies operating in\nIndia, some dating back to 2012. Microsoft was not a party to any of the appeals but is impacted by the\ndecision.\nMicrosoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding\nand tax audit assessments in India. The India Supreme Court ruled favorably for the companies in the 86\nseparate appeals, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although\nMicrosoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft's software sales in India were determined to be not\nsubject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the\nthird quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal\nyear 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the India Supreme Court decision to aid\ninvestors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these non-GAAP measures assist\ninvestors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting\nits business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction\nwith GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of\nfinancial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this\ninformation, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than\nUnited States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the\ncomparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All\ngrowth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this\nnon-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance.

For example, in the third quarter, the company:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAnnounced it is investing nearly $1 billion in pay increases for its fulfillment network employees over the next year in\nthe U.S., bringing average pay to more than $19 per hour.\nExpanded Anytime Pay to provide hourly employees with instant access to up to 70% of their pay at any time during\nthe month.\nCelebrated the 10-year anniversary of Career Choice, an education benefit that empowers employees to learn new\nskills for career success and has seen over 90,000 employees participate so far.\nAnnounced it is investing more than $450 million over the next year to help Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) support\ntheir teams with access to new and improved benefits, and additional rate increases. One new benefits provider, Next\nMile, offers drivers employed by participating DSPs access to more than 1,700 academic programs with tuition\nassistance from their DSP. Participating DSPs are eligible to receive up to $5,250 per driver per year from Amazon to\nhelp cover the costs of tuition assistance.\nExpanded career advancement and development programs for front-line employees, such as offering the Amazon\nIntelligence Initiative to enhance technical skills and place employees in engineering roles within AWS.\nAnnounced plans to hire 150,000 people for open seasonal, full-time, and part-time roles across its operations network\nin the U.S. to help deliver for customers during the holidays.\nIntroduced an additional, free mental wellness program for employees and their families in the U.S., the UK, and\nBrazil. Offered through Twill Therapeutics, the tools and services to improve mental health are available 24/7 and can\nbe used to address in-the-moment concerns or as part of a daily mental health and well-being routine.\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities\nin which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a small\nsampling of the many efforts from this past quarter include Amazon:\n•\n•\nSupporting people affected by Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida by providing hundreds of\nthousands of essential products such as water filters and medical supplies; sending more than 320,000 bottles of water\nto residents of Jackson, Mississippi, suffering from a shortage of clean water; and donating items such as blankets and\nflashlights after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Sichuan Luding, China.\nContinuing to support people impacted by the war in Ukraine with product donations to refugees, financial support to\nmore than 150 nonprofits on the ground in Eastern Europe, and cloud credits and technological assistance through\nAWS. As part of the support for the Ukrainian government, AWS sent Snowball devices-ruggedized compute and\nstorage hardware—into Ukraine to help secure, store, and transfer over 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential\ndata to the cloud. These Snowball devices were the foundation for the effort to preserve Ukraine's data—including\nstate registries, education records, and other essential databases—which are critical in rebuilding the country. Amazon\nhas donated more than $45 million in assistance since the start of the war and waived the referral fee for all Ukrainian\nsmall and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon's European stores. In addition, AWS launched IT Skills 4U, a\nfree workforce-development initiative to provide Ukrainians around the world with access to skills training.\nCommitting to hire at least 5,000 refugees in the U.S. by the end of 2024. The company is also providing support and\nresources through its Welcome Door program, which launched in April 2022 to help refugee employees navigate the\nimmigration process.\nCommitting $147 million to create and preserve 1,260 affordable homes across the Washington, D.C., metro area in\npartnership with minority-led organizations. This investment is the latest initiative by the Amazon Housing Equity\nFund, a $2 billion commitment to create and preserve affordable homes in Amazon's hometown communities.\nAnnouncing plans to invest more than €1 billion over the next five years to further electrify and decarbonize its\ntransportation network across Europe. This includes investments in electric trucks, vans, and micro mobility solutions\nlike e-cargo bikes, as well as charging infrastructure.\nAnnouncing agreements with Plug Power to supply 10,950 tons of green hydrogen per year for Amazon's\ntransportation and building operations, and with Infinium to bring clean-burning electrofuels to Amazon's middle mile\ntransportation fleet starting next year.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n=== TABLE START ===\n| (\"Brazil.

The AWS team continues to innovate and deliver\nat a rapid clip, particularly in generative AI, where the combination of our custom AI chips, Amazon Bedrock being the easiest\nand most flexible way to build and deploy generative AI applications, and our coding companion (CodeWhisperer) allowing\nenterprises to have the equivalent of an experienced engineer who understands all of their proprietary code is driving\nmomentum with customers, including adidas, Booking.com, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines,\nall of whom are starting to run generative AI workloads on AWS. Between AWS re:Invent and our 29th holiday shopping\nseason, this is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we're excited for what's to come.\"\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers' lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services.\nThis is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:\n•\n•\n•\n•\nSold hundreds of millions of items worldwide during Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon's largest two-day October\nholiday kick-off event ever. Prime members across 19 countries saved more than $1 billion on millions of deals. On\nthe first day of the event, U.S. Prime members purchased more than 25 million items with Same-Day or Next-Day\nDelivery, with hundreds of thousands of items delivered within four hours of purchase.\nAnnounced new Buy with Prime features to help merchants grow their businesses on their own websites, such as the\nability to integrate Buy with Prime with Shopify. The Buy with Prime app for Shopify will make it easier for Shopify\nmerchants to manage their businesses, with inventory, pricing, and promotions automatically synced in one place. In\naddition, Buy with Prime Assist enables merchants to offer 24/7 post-order customer service support at no additional\ncost, and the Buy with Prime cart feature allows customers to purchase multiple Buy with Prime products in one\ntransaction from a single merchant.\nAnnounced new offerings to help customers get and stay healthy, including an expanded Amazon Clinic virtual health\ncare marketplace now available across the U.S. to provide care for more than 35 conditions, and 60-minute delivery of\nmedications through Amazon Pharmacy using Prime Air drones in College Station, Texas.

Amazon\nalso announced the Sustainability Solutions Hub, a new resource to help independent sellers in France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain, UK, and U.S. with product and packaging sustainability efforts.\nInvested in direct air capture, a technology that chemically scrubs carbon dioxide from the air before storing it deep\nunderground or in applications like building materials and low-carbon fuels, from 1PointFive and CarbonCapture Inc.\nAnnounced that in 2022 Amazon decreased single-use plastic by 11.6% across its global operations by expanding\npaper-based packaging, continuing to use lighter and more flexible packaging, and eliminating packaging altogether\nwhere possible.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of October 26, 2023, and are subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and\nspending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,\nthe rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors\ndetailed below.\nFourth Quarter 2023 Guidance\n•\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $160.0 billion and $167.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 12% compared\nwith fourth quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $7.0 billion and $11.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in fourth\nquarter 2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic\nand geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify\nmany of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter\n2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic\nand geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify\nmany of these risks.

AWS is helping Ukraine build up cybersecurity defenses and has already migrated 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential data to the cloud from 27 Ukrainian ministries, 18 Ukrainian universities, the country's largest remote learning K-12 school, and dozens of private-sector companies like PrivatBank, which serves 40% of the Ukrainian population and worked with AWS to securely migrate all its operations to the cloud in less than 45 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded AWS the Ukraine Peace Prize for preserving the country's digital infrastructure by migrating state registries and critical databases to AWS. Since the start of the war, Amazon has donated more than 2 million products to over 45 organizations supporting refugees, including 200,000 hygiene kits packed by Amazon employees around the world. • In partnership with Welcome. US and resettlement agencies across the U.S., Amazon created the Welcome Essentials initiative using Amazon's logistics expertise and product selection to offer refugee families free delivery of essential products, like furniture and household items, to help more than 1,000 families resettling in more than 40 cities in the U.S. this year. On top of this logistics support, Amazon has committed $2 million in donations of essential products to supporting partners. Amazon doubled the capacity of its Humanitarian Relief Hub in Atlanta to 1 million critical relief supplies that are ready to ship to communities in the Gulf Coast, the Caribbean, and Central America that have been affected by natural disasters. The facility has 20,000 cubic feet of storage space dedicated to relief items, and Amazon works with humanitarian partners around the world to deploy essential supplies when a disaster strikes, using Amazon's global logistics network. Since 2017, Amazon has provided more than 18 million items to support relief partners worldwide during 81 natural disasters. With $96 million in cash donations to more than 180 organizations, Amazon was recognized by the Puget Sound Business Journal as the top corporate philanthropist in its home state of Washington. These contributions were part of Amazon's total global donations of more than $360 million last year. Amazon was awarded the Defender of Innocence Award by the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project. This award recognized Amazon's legal department for its pro bono work to prevent and correct the conviction of innocent people in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Over the past few years, 120 Amazon lawyers in more than 14 countries have spent hundreds of hours screening, evaluating, and litigating cases for the organization—more time, people, and resources than any other company or law firm. Amazon announced additional investments in affordable housing projects in its hometown communities through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund's $2 billion commitment. The Fund invested more than $30 million to create and preserve 705 affordable homes in Nashville, Tennessee, and in Seattle. The projects are in neighborhoods facing increasing rents and displacement pressures, and five out of the six investments are with local minority-led organizations. Since the launch of the Fund in 2021, Amazon has created or preserved over 8,000 affordable homes, increasing the affordable housing inventory in Bellevue, Washington, and Arlington, Virginia, by at least 20% in one year. • In India, Amazon raised its pledge to now enable $20 billion in cumulative exports by 2025. Since launching in 2015, Amazon's Global Selling program has grown to more than 100,000 exporters that are showcasing millions of Made in India products to customers worldwide through Amazon's store. Indian exporters are on track to surpass $5 billion in cumulative exports. In Italy, Amazon announced a new pledge to help the more than 18,000 small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon reach €1.2 billion in annual export sales by 2025. This pledge will support the objectives of the Italian government's National Recovery and Resilience Plan while ensuring a wider availability of original Italian products to customers worldwide. • In India, Amazon launched Smart Commerce, a new initiative to further digitize local retail stores by enabling them to create customized online storefronts and provide an enhanced in-store shopping experience. Stores of any size will now take advantage of Amazon's shopping innovations, logistics, and digital payments to provide a reliable and trustworthy experience for customers in store, directly through their dedicated online storefronts or on Amazon.in. There are more than 150,000 local stores already selling on Amazon.in, and Amazon is committed to digitizing 10 million small businesses, including local stores, by 2025.

This\nrollout is the start of what Amazon plans to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of 2022—and\n100,000 EDVs across the U.S. by 2030. In India, Amazon signed an agreement with Tata Motors to include the new\nTata Ace electric vehicle as part of Amazon's delivery fleet. The new EDV was co-developed with Amazon and will\ncontribute to the company's goal of having 10,000 EDVs on the road in India by 2025. In the UK, Amazon announced\nthe launch of its first micromobility hub for more sustainable deliveries in central London. E-cargo bikes and walkers\nfrom the new hub, along with Amazon's electric fleet already on London's roads, will make over 5 million deliveries a\nyear across more than 10% of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone.\nAmazon's Climate Pledge Fund made new investments in Electric Hydrogen and Sunfire, two developers of\nelectrolyzer technologies. Electrolyzer technology makes green hydrogen using water and renewable electricity. The\nFund has announced investments in 18 companies to date as part of its mission to invest in visionary companies whose\nproducts and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe Climate Pledge announced a collaboration with the National Geographic Society to fund 15 National Geographic\nExplorers as they document the global climate crisis as part of the Society's Global Storytellers Fund. The\ncollaboration will advance early career and established storytellers—including photographers, writers, and filmmakers\n―with the funding, training, and exposure necessary to help inspire global audiences and drive urgent action against\nthe climate crisis.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 28, 2022, and are subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty\nregarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic\nconditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world\nevents, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This\nguidance reflects our estimates as of July 28, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well\nas the effect of other factors discussed above.\nThird Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $125.0 billion and $130.0 billion, or to grow between 13% and 17% compared\nwith third quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 390 basis points from\nforeign exchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $3.5 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in third quarter 2021.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic\nconditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information\nabout factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

Our Consumer business has\ngrown 23% annually over the past two years, with extraordinary growth in 2020 of 39% year-over-year that necessitated\ndoubling the size of our fulfillment network that we'd built over Amazon's first 25 years—and doing so in just 24 months.\nToday, as we're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and\ncost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some\ntime, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a\nnumber of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we're now approaching levels not seen\nsince the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020.\"\nHighlights\nShopping\nAmazon announced Buy with Prime, a new benefit for Prime members in the U.S. that extends the convenience of\nshopping with Prime to online stores beyond Amazon.com.

These EVs will be part of Amazon's transportation and logistics services, and contribute to Amazon\nIndia's commitment of adding 10,000 electric vehicles to its delivery fleet by 2025.\nAs part of AWS's ongoing commitment to help customers reduce their environmental impact and reach their\nsustainability goals, AWS launched a carbon footprint tool that helps customers quantify their carbon usage across\nAWS products. The tool gives AWS customers a view of their historic carbon emissions, evaluates emission trends as\ntheir use of AWS evolves, estimates the carbon emissions they have avoided by using AWS instead of an on-premises\nsolution, and projects forecasted emissions based on current usage.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of April 28, 2022, and are subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\nuncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world\nevents, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This\nguidance reflects our estimates as of April 28, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well\nas the effect of other factors discussed above.\nSecond Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\n•\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $116.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 7% compared with\nsecond quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income (loss) is expected to be between $(1.0) billion and $3.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second\nquarter 2021.\nThis guidance assumes that Prime Day occurs in third quarter 2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic\nconditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information\nabout factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information\nabout us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate\ngovernance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain\nmaterial information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from\nreferring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and\nanalyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to\nour historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency\nwith respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are\nused by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP\nconstant currency revenues\" included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\n3\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted\ninclude, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June\n30, 2021, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor\nand on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. All information provided in this release and in the\nattachments is as of October 26, 2021. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in\nthis press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to\nupdate this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from\nreferring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and\nanalyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to\nour historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency\nwith respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are\nused by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP\nconstant currency revenues\" included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\n3\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

In the last few years, Amazon has added more product selection available\nwith fast, free, unlimited Prime shipping; more exclusive deals and discounts; and more high-quality digital entertainment,\nincluding TV, movies, music, and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals, rolling out new\nseries and movies like The Boys, The Wheel of Time, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, The Underground Railroad, Sound of Metal,\nComing 2 America, The Tomorrow War, and Being the Ricardos. This September, Prime Video will release the highly\nanticipated The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of a\nhistoric 11-year agreement with the National Football League (NFL). Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of Free Same-Day\nDelivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90, items available for Prime free shipping have increased over\n50%, and members have saved billions of dollars shopping Prime Day. This is all on top of new program benefits like\nprescription savings and fast, free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music for Prime\nmembers, Prime Reading, and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits as well as the rise in\nwages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the U.S., with the monthly fee going\nfrom $12.99 to $14.99, and the annual membership from $119 to $139. This is the first time Amazon has raised the price of\nPrime since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18, 2022, and for current Prime\nmembers, the new price will apply after March 25, 2022, on the date of their next renewal.\nHighlights\nShopping\n•\n•\n•\nAmazon had its biggest-ever Black Friday to Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend, with apparel, beauty, home,\nand toys among the top-selling categories.

More than 130,000 third-party sellers\nworldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon, and between Black Friday and Christmas, U.S.-based third-party\nsellers sold an average of 11,500 products per minute. In addition, Amazon India's month-long Great Indian Festival\nsales event was the biggest shopping celebration ever for sellers and brand partners on Amazon.in, with nearly 30,000\nsellers surpassing $100,000 in sales.\nPrime members are taking advantage of program benefits in record numbers. In 2021, members in the U.S. received\nmore than 6 billion free deliveries, and over 200 million Prime members worldwide streamed shows and movies.\nAmazon Style, Amazon's first-ever physical store for apparel, will open this year at The Americana at Brand, a top\nshopping destination in greater Los Angeles. Amazon Style is built around personalization and innovation. It uses\nmachine learning algorithms to produce tailored recommendations in real time as customers shop, making it easier\nthan ever to discover new looks.

Amazon donated more than 300,000 emergency aid items, including clothing, food, generators, medical supplies, shelter equipment, and water, to support communities affected by tornadoes in the Midwest and Southern U.S.; wildfires in Colorado; and flooding in Chennai and Uttarakhand, India, and in British Columbia, Canada. Amazon announced it has now delivered more than 20 million meals to vulnerable families disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 in more than 25 U.S. cities and communities in Australia, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and the UK. Since March 2020, Amazon has volunteered its delivery network to support food banks and community organizations by delivering groceries and pre-packaged meals to hard-hit areas. • Amazon released economic impact figures in France, Italy, Spain, and the UK: • In France, Amazon invested over €11 billion between 2010 and 2020.

{"id": "348", "doc_name": "amazon-q4-2021", "page_number": "8", "page_content": "=== START PAGE CONTENT ===\nAmazon announced a range of initiatives during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to fight\nclimate change. The initiatives include:\n•\n•\n•\nMobilizing $1 billion to protect tropical forests via the LEAF (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest\nfinance) Coalition, an ambitious public-private initiative designed to protect tropical forests and support\nsustainable development.\nJoining the First Movers Coalition, a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the U.S. Office of\nthe Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry to promote buying low-carbon products.\nParticipating in the Corporate Clean Energy Demand Initiative to promote countries and companies working\ntogether to advance shared clean energy goals by leveraging corporate clean energy commitments.\nJoining the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance and helping to found the Aviators Group to accelerate the\ntransition to net-zero emissions air transport.\nAmazon received the Terra Carta Seal Award from His Royal Highness Prince Charles in recognition of the\ncompany's climate leadership. The Terra Carta Seal is awarded to companies that hold a leadership position within\ntheir industry and that have credible transition roadmaps underpinned by globally recognized, scientific metrics for\nachieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or earlier.\nAmazon announced 18 new utility-scale wind and solar energy projects in Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and\nthe U.S., representing 2 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity and increasing Amazon's renewable energy\nprocurement by 40% in one year. With 274 renewable energy projects, Amazon continues to be the largest corporate\nbuyer of renewable energy globally and is on a path to power 100% of its business operations with renewable energy\nby 2025-five years ahead of its 2030 target.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\nuncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world\nevents, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This\nguidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as\nwell as the effect of other factors discussed above.\nFirst Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with\nfirst quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign\nexchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter\n2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated\nuseful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a\nvariety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the global\neconomic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court issued a decision on\nwithholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The\nCommissioner of Income Tax. Microsoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales\nthrough distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India Supreme Court ruled\nfavorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are\nnot subject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft's\nsoftware sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft\nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the\nresults of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the India Supreme Court decision to aid\ninvestors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these non-GAAP measures assist\ninvestors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting\nits business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction\nwith generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial results in evaluating business performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for,\nor superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

Customers have appreciated this commitment, which\nis part of what's driving this past quarter's AWS growth acceleration to 39% year over year; but, it's also driven extraordinary\ninvestments across our businesses to satisfy customer needs—just one example is that we've nearly doubled the size of our\nfulfillment network since the pandemic began. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs\nin our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and\nincreased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling\npartners this holiday season. It'll be expensive for us in the short term, but it's the right prioritization for our customers and\npartners.\"\nHighlights\nInnovating for Our Retail Customers\nAmazon kicked off the holidays early this year, announcing Black Friday-worthy deals on October 4, including\nthousands of deals from independent sellers and handmade artisans and Amazon's biggest ever selection of gift guides.\nAmazon launched new features like the Holiday Gift List to let customers easily create and share one list of gift ideas\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n=== TABLE START ===\n|    | ('',)                                                                                | ('Q2 2020',)   | ('Q3 2020',)   | ('Y/Y % Change Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021',)   |\n|---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Net Sales                                                                            |                |                |                                                     |\n|  1 | Online stores (1)                                                                    | $ 45,896       | $ 48,350       | $ 66,451 $ 52,901 $ 53,157 $ 49,942 3%              |\n|  2 | Online stores -- Y/Y growth, excluding F/X                                           | 49 %           | 37 %           | 43 % 41 % 13 % 3% N/A                               |\n|  3 | Physical stores (2)                                                                  | $ 3,774        | $ 3,788        | $ 4,022 $ 3,920 $ 4,198 $ 4,269 13 %                |\n|  4 | Physical stores -

Pledge signatories generate over $1.8 trillion in global annual revenue and have more than 7 million employees\nacross 26 industries in 21 countries.\nThe Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion venture capital fund to support the development of sustainable and\ndecarbonizing technologies and services, made new investments in three companies: CMC Machinery, a technology\ncompany that designs and manufactures custom-sized boxes while eliminating the need for single-use plastic padding;\nResilient Power, a builder of solid-state power stations for electric vehicles; and Infinium, a company working toward\na low-carbon electrofuels solution for air transport, marine freight, and heavy truck fleets. In total, the Climate Pledge\nFund has invested in 11 companies.\nAmazon's Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands\naround the world, announced an investment in the Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator, a nature-based carbon\nremoval initiative in the Brazilian Amazon, and a commitment of approximately $23.5 million (€20 million) for\nprojects across Europe to help fight climate change. The first funding recipient is the Parco Italia urban forestry\nprogram, which aims to plant 22 million trees—one tree per city resident—across 14 metropolitan areas in Italy.\nAmazon co-founded The Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels network alongside the Aspen Institute, IKEA,\nInditex, Michelin, Patagonia, Tchibo, and fellow Pledge signatories Brooks Running and Unilever. The initiative aims\nto transition ocean freight vessels from fossil fuels to zero-carbon fuels by 2040.\nLast year, Amazon became the first consumer electronics manufacturer to commit to addressing, through renewable\nenergy development, the electricity used by its devices—starting with Echo devices. Amazon recently announced\nadditional investments in wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, are expected to produce the clean energy\nequivalent of all the electricity used by Fire TV and Ring devices worldwide.\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n"}

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\nuncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the\nrate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance\nreflects our estimates as of October 28, 2021 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the\neffect of other factors discussed above.\nFourth Quarter 2021 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $130.0 billion and $140.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 12% compared\nwith fourth quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from\nforeign exchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $3.0 billion, compared with $6.9 billion in fourth quarter 2020.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\nsettlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's\nfinancial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of\nreasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales\nderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops\ncommercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,\nservices, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or\nunforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these\nrisks.

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court issued a decision on\nwithholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The\nCommissioner of Income Tax. Microsoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales\nthrough distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India Supreme Court ruled\nfavorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are\nnot subject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft's\nsoftware sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft\nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the\nresults of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the India Supreme Court decision to aid\ninvestors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these non-GAAP measures assist\ninvestors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting\nits business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction\nwith GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures\npresented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of\nfinancial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this\ninformation, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than\nUnited States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the\ncomparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All\ngrowth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this\nnon-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance.

In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we\nrecorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur\nadditional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nThese severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):\nCost of revenues\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal charges\nSeverance and\nRelated\nOffice Space\nTotal\n$\n461\n$\n220 $\n681\n835\n247\n1,082\n445\n35\n480\n253\n62\n315\n$\n1,994 $\n564 $\n2,558\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in\nour segment results.\nChange in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a reduction in depreciation expense of\n$988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share.\nTiming of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants\nBeginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to\nMarch. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full\nfiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining\nquarters of the year.\nStock Repurchases\nOn April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to\ntime, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.\nWebcast and conference call information\nA live audio webcast of our first quarter 2023 earnings release call will be available on YouTube at https://\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=76CVRgZUfps. The call begins today at 2:00 PM (PT) / 5:00 PM (ET).

Additional information will also be set\nforth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and may be set forth in other\nreports and filings we make with the SEC.

Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which\nare based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless\nrequired by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP,\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures\nalso facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons\nto our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in\naccordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliation from\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\" and \"Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP\nconstant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in\nconstant currency revenues\" included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\n4\n\n=== END PAGE CONTENT ===\n=== TABLE

We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law. About non-GAAP financial measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both |\n|  6 | because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.
